This the the second and final programming assignment for CPSC 1060. I have created a haunted house, in which zombies lurk. Each room has zombies, that will inflict random amounts of damage. The program also sets a random room in the house to final room. The player starts with 100 health, and is tasked getting to the mystery room alive (>0 health).
